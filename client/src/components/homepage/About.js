                <h2>A MESSAGE FROM CO-FOUNDERS</h2>
                <p>Everybody needs a buddy no matter who you are.</p>
                <p> When was the last time you talked about your buddy? As children we have a constant flow of “best friends”, a “buddy” but as adults, the term becomes far less common. Juggling family, a career and household can make maintaining friendships difficult, let alone best friend status.</p>
                <p>A Buddy – a best friend who is the one will emotionally support you, connect you with the others can’t understand you. A buddy is also the person who thinks you are important, value your opinion, make you feel wanted, they are there with a shoulder to cry on, a listening ear or join you on any adventure. In return, to be a someone else’s buddy, you are more in tune with needs of another person, just do the right thing when needed.</p>
                <p> A buddy will bring you fun, safety, loyalty and Trust, they will be there with you when they say they will.</p>
                <p>When the pandemic was coming in early of 2020, we had more time together to realize how important the friendship to our life</p>
                <p> June 8 is Best Friend Day, and we think it’s time to bring back the BFF – the Buddy to our life, so we decided to build  an online store to enhance our friendship by working as a team to be your buddy by choosing the best products in healthcare, skincare and lifestyle.</p>
                <p> Buddy Store is not only a place that you can shop the good product for taking care yourself and your beloved ones, but also the place that you can share your story, your experiences, your hobby by joining our community to share the good energy to everyone.</p>
